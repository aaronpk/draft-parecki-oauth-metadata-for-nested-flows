           OAuth Client and Device Metadata for Nested Flows
          draft-parecki-oauth-metadata-for-nested-flows-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a vocabulary and method of transmitting
   information about an OAuth client to authorization servers during an
   OAuth flow that the user may need to redirect through that sit behind
   the first authorization server the client is interacting with.  This
   provides the deeper nested authorization servers with additional
   context that they can use for informational or revocation purposes.
